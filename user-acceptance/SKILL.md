name: user-acceptance
description: Use when finishing a ticket, feature branch, or pull request and the user asks to validate, demo, verify, sign off, show that it works, run UAT, provide acceptance evidence, or decide whether work is ready to merge. This skill gathers tangible evidence that completed work functions as intended, with videos, screenshots, terminal recordings, JSON responses, output files, logs, and a concise human test guide. Use for web apps, CLI and TUI apps, APIs and SDKs, and native apps including Electron-type apps. Trigger on phrases like "UAT", "verify", "show me it works", "demo this", "walk me through", "ready to merge", "can we merge?", "acceptance test", "validate the changes", "sign off", or any request for proof that a feature branch or PR works.

# User Acceptance Evidence

## Operating brief

When this skill triggers, gather real evidence that the feature branch, ticket, or PR works. Treat the request as: "prove the completed work by exercising it and producing artifacts a human can inspect."

Acceptance evidence should be experiential and reproducible:

- For UI changes, capture video when practical, then screenshots at meaningful checkpoints. Video captures timing, transitions, focus, and end-to-end flow.
- For CLI and TUI apps, capture terminal transcripts, screenshots, recordings, generated files, and exit codes.
- For APIs and SDKs, capture requests, responses, output files, logs, and small runnable examples.
- For native apps, including Electron-type apps, strongly prefer `/computer-use` when available to drive the real app window and validate acceptance criteria through normal user-visible behavior.

Automated tests can supplement UAT, but they do not replace an in-app walkthrough, command run, API call, or SDK example.

## Supported targets

Use this skill for:

1. Web apps
2. CLI and TUI apps
3. APIs and SDKs
4. Native apps, including Electron-type apps

If the requested target is outside this list, ask whether to proceed with a best-effort evidence plan.

## Hard gates

1. **Scope lock first**
   - Start with `UAT Scope: <ticket/PR/branch scope only>`.
   - If the scope is unclear, inspect the branch diff, PR, ticket, or ask the user.

2. **Evidence before recommendation**
   - Do not recommend merge based only on summaries, static code review, or green tests.
   - Exercise the changed behavior and save artifacts.

3. **Video-first visible evidence for UI changes**
   - For web, TUI, and native app work, capture video when practical, especially when the change affects interaction, layout, transitions, state changes, or error handling.
   - Also capture screenshots at meaningful checkpoints so reviewers can inspect static states.
   - If video is not practical, state why it was skipped.

4. **Manual run instructions are mandatory**
   - Always include steps the human can run themselves.
   - For UI work, primary instructions must use normal product-user actions.
   - For CLI, TUI, API, or SDK work, include copy-pasteable commands or code snippets with expected outcomes.

5. **No GO verdict without explicit human acceptance**
   - Before user confirmation, use `Recommendation: Pending user sign-off`.
   - Use `GO` or `GO with follow-ups` only after the user explicitly accepts.

6. **Do not claim acceptance completion unilaterally**
   - Evidence collection supports acceptance.
   - The human grants acceptance.

7. **Adversarial evidence review**
   - When subagents are available, ask at least one adversarial reviewer to compare the gathered evidence against the spec, acceptance criteria, requirements, PR description, or ticket.
   - The reviewer must provide `Pass` or `Fail` for each criterion and cite the artifact path or log line that supports the judgment.
   - If subagents are unavailable, perform the same review inline and label it `Inline adversarial review`.

## Tool selection

Load and use the best available skill or CLI for the target. If a required skill or CLI is unavailable, install it with `npx agents install <skill-name>`, then follow that skill's installation instructions for its underlying CLI.

| Target | Preferred tools | Evidence to capture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web app | `agent-browser`; `playwright` when the repo already uses Playwright or traces are useful; `chrome-cdp` only for an already-open Chrome page with user approval | Video, screenshots, DOM/accessibility snapshots, console/network notes |
| CLI app | Shell commands, `script`, generated output files; `/computer-use` skill (if available) for terminal video/GIF when visual proof helps | Terminal transcript, exit codes, output files, JSON, screenshots/video for interactive flows |
| TUI app | `/computer-use` skill (if available) for terminal recording or screenshots; terminal transcript where possible | Video/GIF, screenshots, transcript, config/output files |
| API | `curl`, HTTP client, repo scripts, logs | Request/response JSON, status codes, logs, saved payloads |
| SDK | Minimal runnable example in the target language, repo examples/tests only as supplement | Source snippet, command output, generated files, logs |
| Native app, including Electron-type | `/computer-use` skill if available for app-window driving, interaction, accessibility inspection, screenshots, and recording; `agent_browser` Electron/CDP automation when the app exposes useful browser automation or CDP proof is needed | Window video, screenshots, accessibility snapshots, logs |

Installation checks:

```bash

# Then verify the underlying CLI required by the chosen skill
command -v agent-browser || true
```

Do not install tools that are unrelated to the target.

## Evidence workspace

Use the bundled helpers when practical. Resolve script paths relative to this skill directory.

```bash
# Create the evidence directory and starter manifest.
node <skill-dir>/scripts/init-evidence.mjs --target electron --scope "validated behavior"

# Run commands while saving logs, exit codes, and manifest entries.
node <skill-dir>/scripts/run-capture-command.mjs --evidence <dir> --name focused-vitest -- pnpm test

# Capture a CDP-accessible web/Electron page when agent-browser screenshots fail.
node <skill-dir>/scripts/cdp-capture-page.mjs --evidence <dir> --cdp http://127.0.0.1:9222 --title "Kata Desktop" --screenshot screenshots/start.png --text logs/start-text.txt

# Generate and check final artifacts before responding.
node <skill-dir>/scripts/write-report.mjs --evidence <dir>
node <skill-dir>/scripts/verify-evidence.mjs --evidence <dir>
```

The helpers do not replace judgment. They prevent common evidence mistakes: missing exit codes, empty reports, invalid `evidence.json`, absent UI screenshots/video, and command output that was never saved.

Write generated evidence under a repo-local folder:

```text
uat-evidence/<target>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/
```

Create artifacts as appropriate:

```text
evidence.json          # machine-readable manifest
evidence.md            # concise human report
screenshots/           # PNG/JPG checkpoints
recordings/            # MP4/GIF terminal or UI recordings
responses/             # JSON/API/SDK outputs
logs/                  # command logs, server logs, console excerpts
outputs/               # generated files from the feature
```

Keep evidence paths stable and report them in the final answer. If `uat-evidence/` is not ignored by git, mention that it should be ignored before committing unless the user explicitly wants artifacts committed.

A minimal `evidence.json` should include:

```json
{
  "scope": "validated behavior",
  "target": "web|cli|tui|api|sdk|native|electron",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "git_commit": "short sha",
  "artifacts": [
    {"type": "video|screenshot|json|log|output", "path": "relative/path", "description": "what it proves"}
  ],
  "commands": [
    {"command": "command run", "exit_code": 0, "output_path": "logs/example.log"}
  ],
  "slices": [
    {"name": "slice name", "result": "Pass|Fail", "evidence": ["relative/path"]}
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

### 1. Identify scope, target, and acceptance slices

- Inspect branch diff, PR description, ticket, README, package scripts, and app entry points as needed.
- Declare `UAT Scope: ...`.
- Declare `Target: web | cli | tui | api | sdk | native | electron | mixed`.
- Break the scope into 2 to 5 acceptance slices.
- Define visible pass/fail criteria for each slice.

### 2. Prepare the app or service

- Start the dev server, service, CLI, TUI, API, SDK fixture, or native/Electron-type app needed for the walkthrough.
- Prefer real local behavior over mocks.
- For web and native/Electron-type targets, check ports and existing processes before launch. Record any cleanup in `logs/`.
- Use the user's normal product command for the product smoke path. If you need CDP, traces, or deterministic screenshots, run a second instrumented path and label it as such.
- Pick free debug ports rather than assuming `9222`; if a port is occupied, save the listener evidence and choose another port.
- If credentials, services, hardware, or permissions block proof, record the blocker and provide the closest reproducible plan. Do not mark blocked slices as passed.

### 3. Execute the feature path

Use the matching playbook:

- Web app UI flows: `references/web-playbook.md`
- Native/Electron-type UI flows: `references/native-electron-playbook.md`
- CLI, TUI, API, and SDK: `references/cli-api-sdk-playbook.md`

For native/Electron-type app-window validation, strongly prefer `/computer-use` if available so the evidence reflects the real desktop surface a user sees.

For mixed work, run the user-facing path first, then the technical proof tied to the same outcome.

### 4. Capture durable evidence

- Save artifacts under `uat-evidence/<target>-<timestamp>/`.
- Capture video for web, native/Electron-type, and TUI when practical.
- Capture screenshots at the start, key state changes, and final success state.
- Capture command output with `tee`, `script`, or `scripts/run-capture-command.mjs`; always save exit codes.
- Save API/SDK JSON responses and generated output files.
- For bugfix UAT, capture negative evidence that the old failure is absent: search logs for the old error string, search active source/docs for removed flags or stale commands, and save zero-match outputs.
- Classify failed checks. If a failing file or behavior changed in the branch, treat the slice as failed. If it is outside the branch diff, report it as an unrelated validation failure with file/error evidence.
- Write `evidence.json` and `evidence.md`, then run `scripts/verify-evidence.mjs` before responding.

### 5. Run adversarial evidence review

- Provide the spec, acceptance criteria, requirements, PR description, or ticket plus the saved artifacts to an adversarial review subagent when available.
- Ask the reviewer to decide `Pass` or `Fail` for each criterion and cite exact evidence paths.
- Treat missing, ambiguous, or inaccessible artifacts as failures for the affected criteria.
- If a reviewer flags a gap, collect more evidence or mark the slice failed before reporting.

### 6. Report results

Use this order:

1. `UAT Scope: ...`
2. `Target: ...`
3. `Slice-by-slice result`
4. `Evidence`
5. `Adversarial Review`
6. `Manual Run Instructions`
7. `Recommendation: Pending user sign-off`
8. `Please reply: accept / reject`

Keep the report concise. Link to artifact paths and explain what each artifact proves.

## Output contract

For every UAT response, include:

```markdown
UAT Scope: <scope>
Target: <web|cli|tui|api|sdk|native|electron|mixed>

Slice-by-slice result:
- Pass/Fail: <slice> - <one-line evidence summary>

Evidence:
- <artifact path> - <what it proves>

Adversarial Review:
- Pass/Fail: <criterion> - <artifact-backed reason>

Manual Run Instructions:
1. <human step or command>
   Expected: <visible result or output>

Recommendation: Pending user sign-off
Please reply: accept / reject
```

For UI targets, manual instructions must start with normal user actions in the running app. Put automation commands or test harnesses only in a clearly labeled `Fallback (Engineering Only)` section.

For CLI, TUI, API, and SDK targets, manual instructions may be commands or code snippets, but they must include expected output and any required environment variables.

## Ticket update guidance

If a ticket or PR is known, offer or perform a status update with:

- Scope validated
- Target and tools used
- Slice pass/fail summary
- Evidence paths or links
- Manual run instructions
- Current recommendation

Before explicit user acceptance, label the update `Pending user sign-off`. After explicit acceptance, record the final verdict if the project workflow requires it.

## Pre-response self-check

Before responding, verify:

- Scope is stated.
- Target is stated.
- Each slice has pass/fail status.
- Evidence artifacts exist or blockers are clearly labeled.
- `evidence.json` is valid and `evidence.md` is non-empty.
- UI evidence includes video plus screenshots when practical, or a stated reason video was skipped.
- UI screenshots/video files exist and are readable.
- Native app validation used `/computer-use` when available, or explains why another tool was used.
- Adversarial review checked every criterion against evidence and produced pass/fail judgments.
- Command logs include exit codes.
- Old-bug negative evidence is saved when validating a fix.
- Dev servers, native/Electron-type apps, or background processes launched for UAT are cleaned up or explicitly left running for the user.
- Manual run instructions are included.
- Recommendation remains `Pending user sign-off` unless the user has accepted.

## Common mistakes

- Running only tests and calling it UAT.
- Reporting a code summary without artifacts.
- Skipping video or screenshots for UI work without explanation.
- Providing Playwright or test commands as the primary manual UI path.
- Forgetting TUI visual evidence.
- Omitting API request and response files.
- Declaring `GO` before the user accepts.
- Installing every tool instead of selecting the best tool for the target.
