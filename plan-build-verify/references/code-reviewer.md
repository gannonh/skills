# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch a code reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the work product, not your thought process, and preserves your own context for continued work.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**

- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**

- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**

```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code reviewer subagent:**

Use Task tool with `general-purpose` type, fill template at `code-reviewer.md`

**Placeholders:**

- `{DESCRIPTION}` - Brief summary of what was built
- `{SPEC_PATH}` - Approved spec path
- `{TASK_ID}` - Task ID or "final review"
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What it should do
- `{BASE_SHA}` - Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` - Ending commit
- `{TEST_EVIDENCE}` - Commands run and results
- `{APPROVED_DEVIATIONS}` - Approved deviations or "None"

**3. Act on feedback:**

- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch code reviewer subagent]
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/specs/deployment-plan.md
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:**

- Review after EACH task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

## Red Flags

**Never:**

- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**

- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification

See template:

## Code Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a code reviewer subagent.

**Purpose:** Review completed work against requirements and code quality standards before it cascades into more work.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Review code changes"
  prompt: |
    You are a Senior Code Reviewer with expertise in software architecture,
    design patterns, and best practices. Your job is to review completed work
    against its plan or requirements and identify issues before they cascade.

    ## What Was Implemented

    {DESCRIPTION}

    ## Spec and task

    Spec path: {SPEC_PATH}
    Task ID: {TASK_ID}

    ## Requirements / Plan

    {PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}

    ## Test evidence

    {TEST_EVIDENCE}

    ## Approved deviations

    {APPROVED_DEVIATIONS}

    ## Git Range to Review

    **Base:** {BASE_SHA}
    **Head:** {HEAD_SHA}

    ```bash
    git diff --stat {BASE_SHA}..{HEAD_SHA}
    git diff {BASE_SHA}..{HEAD_SHA}
    ```

    ## What to Check

    **Plan alignment:**
    - Does the implementation match the plan / requirements?
    - Are deviations justified improvements, or problematic departures?
    - Is all planned functionality present?

    **Code quality:**
    - Clean separation of concerns?
    - Proper error handling?
    - Type safety where applicable?
    - DRY without premature abstraction?
    - Edge cases handled?

    **Architecture:**
    - Sound design decisions?
    - Reasonable scalability and performance?
    - Security concerns?
    - Integrates cleanly with surrounding code?

    **Testing:**
    - Tests verify real behavior, not mocks?
    - Edge cases covered?
    - Integration tests where they matter?
    - All tests passing?

    **Production readiness:**
    - Migration strategy if schema changed?
    - Backward compatibility considered?
    - Documentation complete?
    - No obvious bugs?

    ## Calibration

    Categorize issues by actual severity. Not everything is Critical.
    Acknowledge what was done well before listing issues — accurate praise
    helps the implementer trust the rest of the feedback.

    If you find significant deviations from the plan, flag them specifically
    so the implementer can confirm whether the deviation was intentional.
    If you find issues with the plan itself rather than the implementation,
    say so.

    ## Output Format

    ### Strengths
    [What's well done? Be specific.]

    ### Issues

    #### Critical (Must Fix)
    [Bugs, security issues, data loss risks, broken functionality]

    #### Important (Should Fix)
    [Architecture problems, missing features, poor error handling, test gaps]

    #### Minor (Nice to Have)
    [Code style, optimization opportunities, documentation polish]

    For each issue:
    - File:line reference
    - What's wrong
    - Why it matters
    - How to fix (if not obvious)

    ### Recommendations
    [Improvements for code quality, architecture, or process]

    ### Assessment

    **Ready to merge?** [Yes | No | With fixes]

    **Reasoning:** [1-2 sentence technical assessment]

    ## Critical Rules

    **DO:**
    - Categorize by actual severity
    - Be specific (file:line, not vague)
    - Explain WHY each issue matters
    - Acknowledge strengths
    - Give a clear verdict

    **DON'T:**
    - Say "looks good" without checking
    - Mark nitpicks as Critical
    - Give feedback on code you didn't actually read
    - Be vague ("improve error handling")
    - Avoid giving a clear verdict
```

**Placeholders:**

- `{DESCRIPTION}` — brief summary of what was built
- `{SPEC_PATH}` — approved spec path
- `{TASK_ID}` — task ID or final review
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` — what it should do (spec path, task text, or requirements)
- `{BASE_SHA}` — starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` — ending commit
- `{TEST_EVIDENCE}` — commands run and results
- `{APPROVED_DEVIATIONS}` — approved deviations or "None"

**Reviewer returns:** Strengths, Issues (Critical / Important / Minor), Recommendations, Assessment

### Example Output

```
### Strengths
- Clean database schema with proper migrations (db.ts:15-42)
- Comprehensive test coverage (18 tests, all edge cases)
- Good error handling with fallbacks (summarizer.ts:85-92)

### Issues

#### Important
1. **Missing help text in CLI wrapper**
   - File: index-conversations:1-31
   - Issue: No --help flag, users won't discover --concurrency
   - Fix: Add --help case with usage examples

2. **Date validation missing**
   - File: search.ts:25-27
   - Issue: Invalid dates silently return no results
   - Fix: Validate ISO format, throw error with example

#### Minor
1. **Progress indicators**
   - File: indexer.ts:130
   - Issue: No "X of Y" counter for long operations
   - Impact: Users don't know how long to wait

### Recommendations
- Add progress reporting for user experience
- Consider config file for excluded projects (portability)

### Assessment

**Ready to merge: With fixes**

**Reasoning:** Core implementation is solid with good architecture and tests. Important issues (help text, date validation) are easily fixed and don't affect core functionality.
