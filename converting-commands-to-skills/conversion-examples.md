# Conversion Examples: Commands to Skills

This document provides complete before/after examples of command-to-skill conversions.

## Conversion Types

**Basic Conversion:** Transforms YAML frontmatter and directory structure only. Content below frontmatter is copied as-is with NO changes (keeps @path, !commands, etc.)

**Full Conversion:** Transforms frontmatter, directory structure, AND content (progressive disclosure, @path → ./path, !command → Bash tool instructions, etc.)

---

## Basic Conversion Example

### Before: ./commands/kata/add-phase.md

```markdown
---
description: Add a new phase to the project roadmap
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash]
argument-hint: "[phase-name]"
---

# Add Phase

Add a new phase to the current milestone.

!cat .planning/ROADMAP.md

Update the roadmap file @roadmap-format.md with the new phase.
```

### After: ./skills/kata-adding-phases/SKILL.md (BASIC CONVERSION)

```markdown
---
name: adding-phases
description: Use this skill when adding planned phases to the roadmap, appending sequential work to milestones, or creating new phase entries. Triggers include 'add phase', 'append phase', 'new phase', and 'create phase'.
---

# Add Phase

Add a new phase to the current milestone.

!cat .planning/ROADMAP.md

Update the roadmap file @roadmap-format.md with the new phase.
```

**Changes Made (Basic Conversion):**
- ✅ Name: `add-phase.md` → `adding-phases` (gerund + plural)
- ✅ Directory: `commands/kata/` → `skills/kata-adding-phases/` (category as prefix)
- ✅ Description: Enhanced with trigger keywords and use cases
- ✅ Removed: `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`
- ❌ Content: LEFT AS-IS (kept `!cat`, kept `@roadmap-format.md`)
- ❌ No progressive disclosure
- ❌ No supporting files created

# Planning Project Phases

Create a detailed implementation plan for a project phase.

## Planning Process

### 1. Research Phase Requirements

Gather context about the phase:

```bash
# Check current git status
git status

# List planning files
ls .planning/
```

Review conversation history for:
- User's requirements and constraints
- Previous decisions
- Related completed work

### 2. Break Down Into Tasks

Follow the task breakdown methodology in `./task-breakdown.md`:
- Identify deliverables
- Decompose into atomic tasks
- Estimate complexity
- Identify dependencies

### 3. Launch Planning Agent

Use the Task tool to invoke the kata-planner agent:

```markdown
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "kata-planner"
- prompt: "Create a plan for [phase-name] that achieves [goals]"
- description: "Planning phase implementation"
```

### 4. Review and Validate

After agent completes:
- Verify all requirements are addressed
- Check task dependencies are logical
- Ensure plan is actionable
- Validate against `./plan-format.md`

## Supporting Files

- `./task-breakdown.md` - Task decomposition methodology
- `./dependency-analysis.md` - Dependency mapping guidance

!grep -r "ERROR" . --include="*.log"

@debugging-workflow.md
```

### After: ./skills/kata-debugging-issues/SKILL.md (FULL CONVERSION)

```markdown
---
name: debugging-issues
description: Use this skill when encountering bugs, test failures, or unexpected behavior. Applies systematic debugging methodology with hypothesis testing, minimal reproduction, and root cause analysis. Invoke for any debugging task before proposing fixes.
---

# Debugging Issues Systematically

Apply a systematic approach to debug failing tests or unexpected behavior.

## Debugging Process

### 1. Reproduce the Issue

Run tests and capture output:

```bash
# Run tests and save output
npm test 2>&1 | tee test-output.log
```

### 2. Gather Error Information

Search for error messages and stack traces:

```bash
# Search for errors in logs
grep -r "ERROR" . --include="*.log"

# Search in source files if needed
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|BUG" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"
```

### 3. Apply Debugging Workflow

Follow the systematic debugging methodology in `./debugging-workflow.md`:

1. **Understand** - Read error messages, stack traces, and context
2. **Hypothesize** - Form testable hypotheses about root cause
3. **Test** - Create minimal reproduction
4. **Isolate** - Narrow down to specific code or conditions
5. **Fix** - Apply targeted fix
6. **Verify** - Confirm fix resolves issue without side effects

### 4. Document Findings

After resolving:
- Document root cause
- Update tests if needed
- Consider preventive measures

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Tests are failing
- Unexpected behavior occurs
- Error messages appear
- User reports a bug
- Code behaves differently than expected

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Issue reproduced consistently
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Fix applied and tested
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
```

**Changes Made (Full Conversion):**
