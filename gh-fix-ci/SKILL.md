description: "Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions. Trigger words include: 'fix CI', 'debug GitHub Actions', 'gh pr checks', 'CI is red', 'GitHub Actions failed', 'fix the build', and similar phrases indicating a need to investigate and resolve CI failures in a GitHub-hosted repository."

## Overview

Use gh to locate failing PR checks, fetch GitHub Actions logs for actionable failures, summarize the failures, and implement fixes.

## Inputs

- `repo`: path inside the repo (default `.`)
- `pr`: PR number or URL (optional; defaults to current branch PR)
- `gh` authentication for the repo host

## Quick start

- `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
- Add `--json` if you want machine-friendly output for summarization.

## Workflow

1. Verify gh authentication.
   - Run `gh auth status` in the repo.
   - If unauthenticated, ask the user to run `gh auth login` (ensuring repo + workflow scopes) before proceeding.
2. Resolve the PR.
   - Prefer the current branch PR: `gh pr view --json number,url`.
   - If the user provides a PR number or URL, use that directly.
3. Inspect failing checks (GitHub Actions only).
   - Preferred: run the bundled script (handles gh field drift and job-log fallbacks):
     - `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
     - Add `--json` for machine-friendly output.
   - Manual fallback:
     - `gh pr checks <pr> --json name,state,bucket,link,startedAt,completedAt,workflow`
       - If a field is rejected, rerun with the available fields reported by `gh`.
     - For each failing check, extract the run id from `detailsUrl` and run:
       - `gh run view <run_id> --json name,workflowName,conclusion,status,url,event,headBranch,headSha`
       - `gh run view <run_id> --log`
     - If the run log says it is still in progress, fetch job logs directly:
       - `gh api "/repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/jobs/<job_id>/logs" > "<path>"`
4. Scope non-GitHub Actions checks.
   - If `detailsUrl` is not a GitHub Actions run, label it as external and only report the URL.
   - Do not attempt Buildkite or other providers; keep the workflow lean.
5. Summarize failures.
   - Provide the failing check name, run URL (if any), and a concise log snippet.
   - Call out missing logs explicitly.
6. Create a plan.
   - Use the `create-plan` skill to draft a concise plan.
7. Implement plan.
   - Apply the plan, summarize diffs/tests, commit and push changes.
8. Recheck status.
   - After changes, re-run the relevant tests and `gh pr checks` to confirm.
   - If new or existing failures remain, repeat the workflow until CI passes
9. Summarize outcome.
   - Once CI checks pass, summarize the fix and confirm with the user before merging or proceeding to the next steps in their workflow.

## Bundled Resources

### <path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py

Fetch failing PR checks, pull GitHub Actions logs, and extract a failure snippet. Exits non-zero when failures remain so it can be used in automation.

Usage examples:

- `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "123"`
- `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123" --json`
- `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --max-lines 200 --context 40`
